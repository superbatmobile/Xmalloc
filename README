A segregated list implmentation for dynamic memory allocator

Checkheap and check_list function are provided as helper to show memory allocated. Also could benefit for debugging and furture understanding how the allocator worked.

Could run make to compile the program and run ./mdriver with different options to run the allocator
Different operations are shown by typing unix> mdriver -h
